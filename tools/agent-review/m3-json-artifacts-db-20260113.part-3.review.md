## 0. Status Snapshot (2026-01-11)

This section is a working marker so you can see progress against the design while the DB cutover is in-flight.

Work completed that supports DB-backed persistence:

- Unified operation workflow payload shape across newer registry-style endpoints:
  - Dual-status support (legacy `status` string plus canonical `service_status`)
  - Shared `time_remaining` contract on registry status endpoints, including safe coercion and default fallback behavior
- Multi-capture registry status endpoints aligned to the shared `time_remaining` contract:
  - Multi-RxMER `/advance/multiRxMer/status` (POST)
  - Multi-ChannelEstimation `/advance/multiChannelEstimation/status` (POST)
- Test coverage added to lock in the above contract behavior and keep the validation gate green.

Cutover statement:

- Transactions, capture groups, and operation mappings are DB-backed and authoritative.
- JSON ledgers for capture groups and operations are deprecated and not used at runtime.
- The remaining cutover work focuses on artifact linkage and any residual ledger cleanup.

## 1. Purpose

PyPNM historically persisted transaction metadata using JSON “ledger” files under `.data/db/`. The DB backend is now
authoritative for transactions, capture groups, and operation mappings, and the JSON ledgers are deprecated. This
design defines the target state for replacing the ledger with a relational database while preserving PyPNM’s
operational model
(filesystem-based binary artifacts plus lightweight metadata persistence).

This document is authoritative for:

- PyPNM (authoritative engine and persistence owner)
- PyPNM-CMTS (consumer of PyPNM; inherits PyPNM’s backend choice)

## 2. Scope

In scope:

- Install-time DB backend selection owned by PyPNM (`sqlite` or `postgres`)
- A normalized relational schema for transaction metadata and grouping constructs (capture groups and operations)
- A durable, explicit way to link transactions to one-or-more files on disk (raw capture binaries and future derived artifacts)
- Demo mode isolation using the same schema with different data roots and or a different DB target
- Release hygiene rules to guarantee no runtime DB/data is shipped in sdists wheels images
- Documentation updates to remove ledger JSON design and replace it with DB-backed persistence
- Endpoint compatibility for the existing PNM File Manager API routes (no JSON ledger traversal at runtime)
- CI viability for both backends (SQLite as baseline, Postgres as service-backed integration in CI when enabled)

Out of scope:

- Security sanitization pipeline refactor (tracked as a later work item, but design constraints are captured here)
- Any change to PNM binary formats
- Any separate persistence mechanism in PyPNM-CMTS

## 3. Non-Goals

- No database-specific business logic in PyPNM-CMTS
- No separate DB selection logic in PyPNM-CMTS
- No database embedded in the Python package directory (no `.sqlite3` inside `src/pypnm/...`)
- No requirement for Kubernetes APIs or a K8 operator

## 4. Design Requirements

1) PyPNM owns persistence  
   PyPNM selects the backend and initializes schema. PyPNM-CMTS must use PyPNM APIs only and inherit the same backend.

2) Epoch timestamps  
   All stored timestamps remain epoch seconds.

3) Explicit artifact linkage  
   A transaction must reference one-or-more on-disk artifacts (raw binary capture, uploads, derived artifacts, archives).

4) SysDescr de-duplication  
   `system_description` values are normalized. A special `UNKNOWN` row exists for user uploads lacking sysDescr.

5) Demo mode uses the same schema  
   Same code path, same tables. Only data differs (dataset root and DB target).

6) Paths stored in DB are portable  
   No user-specific absolute paths are stored (for example `/home/dev01/...`). Store repo app-root relative strings.

7) Backward-facing endpoint shapes remain stable  
   The FastAPI file manager endpoints must continue to function with the same request response models (or minimally invasive
   changes), while switching persistence from JSON ledgers to DB.

8) Release artifacts must never ship runtime DB or data  
   Sdists, wheels, and container images must not contain `.data/`, `demo/.data/`, SQLite DB files, or captured artifacts.

9) DB must be capable of resolving a transaction to a binary without legacy settings JSON linkage  
   The DB must provide sufficient metadata to locate the authoritative binary on disk for download, analysis, and hexdump.

10) DB backend guidance must be explicit for multi-worker deployments  
   SQLite is acceptable for single-writer or small deployments. Postgres is recommended for multi-worker service deployments,
   especially when running PyPNM-CMTS on top of PyPNM.

11) Schema version compatibility is enforced  
   PyPNM must persist a schema version (via `schema_meta`) and must fail fast with a clear error if the DB schema version
   is unsupported. No silent or destructive migrations are permitted in normal runtime flows.

## 5. Terminology

- app_root: The runtime root directory resolved by PyPNM (repo root in dev, container path like `/app` in Docker).
- artifact store: A named root directory relative to app_root (for example `.data/pnm`).
- artifact: A file on disk referenced by the DB (raw PNM binary or a derived packaged artifact).
- transaction: A logical capture event (one PNM binary and its metadata).
- capture group: A grouping of multiple transactions captured together.
- operation capture: A higher-level operation identifier that points to a capture group.
- role: A transaction to artifact linkage label that indicates which file is authoritative for a given purpose (for example `pnm_raw`).

## 6. Target Operating Model

### 6.1 DB Responsibility Contract

PyPNM is the persistence owner:

- Selects backend at install time
- Initializes schema (idempotent)
- Enforces schema version compatibility (fail fast on mismatch)
- Provides repository service APIs that hide backend differences
- Owns all queries required by the file manager endpoints

Initialization ownership contract:

- `install.sh` is responsible for selecting the backend and generating settings that describe it.
- PyPNM runtime is responsible for idempotent schema ensurement:
  - SQLite: create directory and DB file under configured `.data/` root when missing.
  - Postgres: validate connectivity, ensure schema exists, and validate `schema_meta.schema_version`.
- PyPNM runtime must never “silently downgrade” or “auto-migrate” a schema across major versions. If schema version is not
  supported, PyPNM must raise a clear, actionable error with remediation steps.

PyPNM-CMTS is a consumer:

- Never selects a different backend
- Never embeds its own schema or persistence logic for PyPNM transaction metadata
- Calls PyPNM APIs for file transaction resolution

### 6.2 What Stays On Disk

Binary artifacts remain filesystem-based:

- Raw PNM binaries captured via SNMP TFTP HTTP and saved into `.data/pnm/` (or demo equivalent)
- Derived files (CSV JSON PNG PDF ZIP) remain in `.data/<type>/` directories as currently designed
- Archives (ZIP) remain under `.data/archive/`

The DB stores metadata and references to those artifacts.

### 6.3 What Moves Into The DB

Replace the JSON ledgers with DB-backed tables:

- Transaction metadata
- Capture group membership and ordering
- Operation capture linkage
- Artifact store roots and artifact file linkage

## 7. Backend Selection And Installation Contract

### 7.1 install.sh Flags And Interactive Prompt

PyPNM’s `install.sh` must support:

- `--db-install-sqlite` (default if not specified)
- `--db-install-postgres`

If neither flag is provided, the installer must prompt:

- Question: choose `sqlite` or `postgres`
- Default: `sqlite`

Selection is written into the generated settings file (for example `settings/system.json`), and PyPNM uses it at runtime.

Implementation status (2026-01-10):

- Flags and interactive selection have been implemented, and selection occurs before pytest so the suite runs against the chosen backend contract.
- Postgres DSN capture supports password redaction and recommends env var injection rather than plaintext persistence.

### 7.2 Configuration Keys

A single configuration contract, applicable to both prod and demo datasets:

```json
{
  "Database": {
    "backend": "sqlite",
    "sqlite": {
      "path": ".data/db/pypnm.sqlite3"
    },
    "postgres": {
      "dsn": ""
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:

- Postgres must accept a DSN at minimum. Discrete fields may exist, but DSN is the lowest common denominator.
- Demo mode may point to `demo/.data/db/pypnm.sqlite3` and the demo artifact root via artifact store seeding.
- Secret handling: the DSN may be supplied via environment variables in service deployments to avoid plaintext passwords in
  tracked configuration files.

DSN resolution order (contract):

1) Environment variable override (if set)
2) Settings file value (`Database.postgres.dsn`)
3) Installer-generated discrete fields (if implemented) composed into a DSN

Recommended environment variable keys (contract):

- `PYPNM_DB_BACKEND` (optional override for dev and CI)
- `PYPNM_DB_POSTGRES_DSN` (preferred secret injection mechanism for Postgres DSN)

Implementation note:

- As of 2026-01-11, the design contract is stable, but `settings/system.json.template` and `SystemConfigSettings` accessors still need to be updated to fully reflect this configuration surface.

### 7.3 DB Location Policy

The DB is runtime state and must live under `.data/` roots, not inside the package directory.

Recommended defaults (repo app-root relative):

- SQLite: `.data/db/pypnm.sqlite3`
- Demo SQLite: `demo/.data/db/pypnm.sqlite3`
- Postgres: external service; no local DB file

### 7.4 PostgreSQL Authentication And Secrets

Development defaults may use `pypnm` / `pypnm` for local containers or CI service containers, but the design requires:

- No credentials hardcoded in source code
- DSN or discrete connection fields populated via:
  - settings file generated by `install.sh`, and or
  - environment variables or secret injection in container deployments
- CI should use a service-container (or equivalent) and pass DSN through env vars
- Documentation must include an example DSN pattern without embedding real customer credentials

Credential guidance contract:

- Local dev and CI may use the well-known defaults:
  - user: `pypnm`
  - password: `pypnm`
  - db: `pypnm`
- Production documentation must explicitly warn that the above defaults are not acceptable for production environments.
- If a password is present in `settings/system.json`, it must only be present because the user explicitly chose to keep it there
  during `install.sh`. In all other cases, prefer DSN injection using `PYPNM_DB_POSTGRES_DSN` and avoid plaintext secrets.

Example DSN pattern (documentation-only example):

- `postgresql://pypnm:${PYPNM_DB_POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@localhost:5432/pypnm`

PyPNM must treat DSN strings as secrets:

- Do not log full DSNs at INFO level (mask or omit password portion).
- If diagnostics need to report connectivity, log only host, port, dbname, user, and SSL mode.

## 8. Release Hygiene Requirements

When building releases (sdist, wheel, container images):

- Never ship `.data/` or `demo/.data/` content
- Never ship any `.sqlite3` or `.db` files
- Never ship customer binary captures or derived artifacts

### 8.1 Git Ignore And Packaging Exclusions

Concrete safeguards:

- `.gitignore` includes `.data/` and `demo/.data/`
- Packaging config excludes `.data/**` and `demo/.data/**`
- Any demo dataset DB file is also excluded (`demo/.data/db/pypnm.sqlite3`)

### 8.2 Docker And Container Image Hygiene

- `.dockerignore` includes `.data/`, `demo/.data/`, `*.sqlite3`, `*.db`
- Dockerfiles do not `COPY` `.data/` or demo datasets into image layers (data must come from runtime volumes)

## 9. Data Model

### 9.1 Dimensions

system_description_dim:

- Normalized sysDescr fields
- Unique by `sysdescr_hash`
- Includes `UNKNOWN` row

device_details:

- References system_description_dim
- Stores device details JSON (extensible)
- Unique by `device_details_hash`

### 9.2 Fact Tables

transaction_records:

- One row per transaction
- Includes transaction_id, timestamp_epoch, mac_address, pnm_test_type, filename (legacy convenience)
- References device_details via device_detail_id

### 9.3 Grouping Constructs

capture_groups:

- One row per capture group id

capture_group_transactions:

- Join table linking capture groups to transactions
- Stores ordering via `position`
- Position assignment uses `MAX(position) + 1` with bounded retries on collisions

operation_captures:

- One row per operation id
- References capture group id
- DB-backed mapping is authoritative; JSON ledgers are deprecated

### 9.4 Artifact Linkage

artifact_stores:

- Named store roots relative to app_root (for example `.data/pnm`, `demo/.data/pnm`)

file_artifacts:

- One row per file artifact
- Unique by `(store_id, relative_path)` and by `sha256`

transaction_artifacts:

- Join table linking transactions to file artifacts
- Includes `role` (for example `pnm_raw`, `pnm_uploaded_raw`, `analysis_zip`, `analysis_json`)

### 9.5 Constraints And Indexing

- MAC address format enforced via CHECK constraints
- Unique constraints on dimension hashes and artifact uniqueness
- Indices on timestamp, mac_address, pnm_test_type, FK columns

### 9.6 UNKNOWN sysDescr Seed Row

The schema seeds a canonical UNKNOWN sysDescr row, used when:

- A file is uploaded by the user and sysDescr cannot be derived
- A capture flow fails to collect sysDescr but still persists a transaction record

Canonical sysDescr JSON example (normal case, not UNKNOWN):

```json
{"HW_REV":"1.0","VENDOR":"LANCity","BOOTR":"NONE","SW_REV":"1.0.0","MODEL":"LCPET-3"}
```

## 10. Path Contract And Portability

### 10.1 Portable Paths

Store only repo app-root relative paths:

- artifact_stores.root_path: store root (for example `.data/pnm`, `demo/.data/pnm`)
- file_artifacts.relative_path: path relative to store root (often a filename, may be nested)

### 10.2 Absolute Path Construction

At runtime:

`absolute_path = Path(app_root) / artifact_stores.root_path / file_artifacts.relative_path`

No absolute paths are stored in the DB.

### 10.3 Demo Isolation

Demo uses:

- Separate DB target (recommended): `demo/.data/db/pypnm.sqlite3`
- Separate artifact store root: `demo/.data/pnm`

Prod uses:

- `.data/db/pypnm.sqlite3`
- `.data/pnm`

Same schema, different data.

## 11. Endpoint Compatibility Requirements

### 11.1 Current File Manager Endpoints

The following endpoints (existing shapes) must remain functionally equivalent:

- `GET /docs/pnm/files/getMacAddresses/`
- `GET /docs/pnm/files/searchFiles/{mac_address}`
- `GET /docs/pnm/files/download/transactionID/{transaction_id}`
- `GET /docs/pnm/files/download/macAddress/{mac_address}`
- `GET /docs/pnm/files/download/operationID/{operation_id}`
- `POST /docs/pnm/files/upload`
- `POST /docs/pnm/files/getAnalysis`
- `GET /docs/pnm/files/getHexdump/transactionID/{transaction_id}`

### 11.2 DB Queries Needed By Each Endpoint

1) getMacAddresses  
   Query: distinct MACs from transaction_records with latest timestamp per MAC, include best-effort system_description derived
   from joined device_details system_description_dim.

2) searchFiles/{mac}  
   Query: transaction_records filtered by mac_address, sorted by timestamp, returning `transaction_id`, `filename`, `pnm_test_type`,
   `timestamp_epoch`, and system_description.

3) download/transactionID/{transaction_id}  
   Query: resolve transaction -> artifact by role (prefer `pnm_raw` then `pnm_uploaded_raw`); construct absolute path; serve file.

4) download/macAddress/{mac}  
   Query: list transactions for MAC; resolve artifacts per transaction; zip.

5) download/operationID/{operation_id}  
   Query: operation -> capture_group -> ordered tx list; resolve artifacts; zip.

6) upload  
   Insert: create transaction record with UNKNOWN sysDescr device_details if necessary; insert artifact and link as `pnm_uploaded_raw`.

7) getAnalysis  
   Resolve file as in download; analysis logic continues as-is once a filesystem path is available.

8) getHexdump  
   Resolve file as in download; hexdump logic continues as-is.

### 11.3 Artifact Resolution Rules

When resolving the on-disk file for a transaction:

- First choice role: `pnm_raw` (captured file)
- Second choice role: `pnm_uploaded_raw` (uploaded file)
- If neither exists, treat as missing file (404)

    D --> E[Zip existing files]
    E --> F[Return zip FileResponse]
```

## 13. Documentation And Tooling Updates

### 13.1 Remove Ledger JSON Design From Docs

Documentation changes required:

- Remove or clearly mark deprecated any documentation that describes JSON ledger persistence as the design
- Update file manager docs to state: transactions capture groups operations are DB-backed; binaries remain on disk
- Update any docs that still imply JSON ledger authority for transaction/group/operation metadata
- Ensure examples and diagrams in docs reflect DB-backed persistence and artifact linkage

### 13.2 Add Mermaid Support To MkDocs And pyproject

Your docs now include Mermaid diagrams. Ensure the docs build supports Mermaid.

Implementation expectations:

- Add Mermaid support in your MkDocs configuration (Material approach is typical):
  - enable `pymdownx.superfences` with mermaid fences, and or
  - add a Mermaid plugin appropriate for your MkDocs stack
- Add the required docs dependency to `pyproject.toml` so `pip install .[docs]` enables Mermaid rendering

Candidate dependency (Codex must verify what your docs stack already uses):

- `mkdocs-mermaid2-plugin`

If your current docs stack already supports Mermaid via existing extensions, treat this as a configuration-only change and do not add redundant dependencies.

## 14. Migration Strategy

### 14.1 Cutover Philosophy

- Introduce schema + DB API first (SQLite path fully testable)
- Migrate write paths to DB, then migrate read paths used by endpoints
- Remove JSON ledger code after DB-backed implementation is verified by tests

Schema versioning posture:

- The initial DB-backed release is `schema_version = 1` (persisted via `schema_meta`).
- PyPNM is permitted to perform idempotent initialization (create tables, seed rows) but is not permitted to perform
  destructive migrations at runtime.
- If a future schema change is required, it must be implemented as an explicit migration step (CLI tool or install-time
  action) with a clear upgrade path and release notes.

### 14.2 Legacy Ledger Data

If you want to preserve legacy ledger data:

- Provide an optional one-time migrator tool that reads old JSON ledgers and inserts DB rows
- Keep it out of normal runtime flow
- Do not ship any populated DB in releases

If you do not need legacy migration, remove the ledgers and start fresh for new installs.

### 14.3 Implementation Milestones And Cutover Moment

Milestone mapping to the burndown:

- Phase 1: Installer/config contract is complete (backend selection, template keys, settings accessors).
- Phase 2: DB abstraction exists and schema init is idempotent for SQLite and wired for Postgres.
- Phase 3: Transactions write and read paths are DB-backed (ledger is no longer authoritative for transactions).
- Phase 4: Capture group and operation persistence is DB-backed (ledger group and operation files are no longer authoritative).
- Phase 5: Artifact linkage exists and file resolution is DB-driven (DB becomes authoritative for locating binaries).
- Phase 6: Ledger JSON code paths and config keys are removed and docs are updated accordingly.

Cutover definition (authoritative):

- PyPNM is considered “DB-only” only after Phase 3 through Phase 6 are complete.
- Until then, any DB work is preparatory and must not introduce behavior that depends on ledgers being present, except for optional offline migration tooling.

## 15. Testing Requirements

- SQLite: unit tests must validate schema init and CRUD without external services
- Postgres: integration is optional, but code paths must be wired and guarded
- Endpoint-level tests (FastAPI TestClient) must validate that the file manager endpoints resolve transactions to paths
  through DB-backed repositories (no JSON file reads)
- Tests must not require live SNMP or CMTS access
- Clean up any pytest coverage that was explicitly validating the JSON-ledger persistence model

### 15.1 CI And GitHub Workflow Considerations

CI contract:

- SQLite must run in all CI jobs (no external dependencies, deterministic).
- Postgres integration must be supported by CI when enabled by the project (recommended once Postgres backend is implemented):
  - a GitHub Actions job using a Postgres service container
  - schema init performed as part of the test setup
  - DSN passed via environment variables (no committed secrets)

Recommended CI Postgres service defaults:

- `POSTGRES_USER=pypnm`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pypnm`
- `POSTGRES_DB=pypnm`

Recommended DSN injection:

- `PYPNM_DB_POSTGRES_DSN=postgresql://pypnm:pypnm@localhost:5432/pypnm`

Minimum CI validation expectations:

- Schema init applies cleanly and seeds `schema_meta` + `UNKNOWN` sysDescr + default artifact store.
- A minimal CRUD test suite passes for Postgres (create transaction, link artifact, resolve path).
- Endpoint-level tests continue to use SQLite by default unless an explicit Postgres job is running.

## 16. Concurrency Model And Backend Guidance

### 16.1 SQLite Concurrency Limits

SQLite is appropriate for:

- Standalone PyPNM usage
- Lab environments
- Small deployments with limited concurrent writes

Operational considerations:

- SQLite is single-writer (concurrent reads are fine, concurrent writes serialize).
- Multi-process deployments (multiple Uvicorn workers) increase contention risk.
- For best behavior, enable WAL mode and set a reasonable busy timeout in the SQLite connection layer.
- For containers: SQLite requires a persistent volume mount and is not suitable for horizontal scaling with multiple replicas
  writing to the same DB file.
- SQLite must be treated as a single-writer backend when PyPNM is deployed as a service.

### 16.2 PostgreSQL Recommendation Guidance

Postgres is recommended for:

- Production deployments with high concurrency
- Any deployment where PyPNM-CMTS runs as a service with multiple workers and frequent reads writes
- Scenarios where multiple PyPNM processes (or containers) may touch the same persistence layer

Guidance statement to include in docs:

- For PyPNM standalone use, SQLite is fine and is the default for minimal-risk installs.
- For PyPNM-CMTS or any multi-worker service mode, Postgres is recommended.

## Overview

This burndown converts PyPNM from JSON ledger persistence under `.data/db/*.json` to a DB-backed persistence layer with install-time backend selection:

- SQLite (local file under `.data/db/pypnm.sqlite3`)
- PostgreSQL (external service)

Binary artifacts remain filesystem-based. The DB stores metadata and references via `artifact_stores`, `file_artifacts`, and `transaction_artifacts`.

PyPNM owns backend selection at install time. PyPNM-CMTS inherits this selection through PyPNM and must not implement a separate DB selection mechanism.

Concurrency note (design constraint carried into implementation and docs):

- SQLite is supported and recommended for single-process / single-writer deployments (PyPNM standalone, labs, demos).
- Postgres is recommended when PyPNM is used as a dependency in PyPNM-CMTS, or whenever multiple workers/processes may access the DB concurrently.

DB-only cutover policy (current intent):

- Runtime persistence is DB-only once a given domain has landed in DB form (transactions in M3; capture groups/ops in M4; artifacts in M5).
- JSON ledgers become legacy-only for migrated domains:
  - Not written by runtime once the DB write paths land for that domain.
  - Not read by runtime endpoints once DB read paths land for that domain.
  - Optional offline migrator may exist, but is not part of runtime behavior.

## Recent Status Update (2026-01-11)

Work completed since the last burndown sync (per Agent Review Bundles and the current codebase snapshot):

- **M2 complete (schema init + DB abstraction layer):**
  - Schema assets maintained as authoritative:
    - `docs/design/db/schema_sqlite.sql`
    - `docs/design/db/schema_postgres.sql`
  - Schema apply/init is idempotent and invoked from startup.
  - Seeds `UNKNOWN` sysDescr row idempotently.
  - Seeds default `artifact_stores` rows idempotently (at least the primary/prod default).

- **M3 complete (transactions and JSON export artifacts are DB-backed; legacy ledgers removed from runtime):**
  - Introduced repository helpers for sysDescr/device_details dimensions and transaction_records.
  - Wired `PnmFileTransaction` reads/writes to DB while preserving legacy payload shapes.
  - Updated file manager reads (`search_files`, `get_mac_addresses`) to query DB-backed repositories.
  - Updated tests to seed DB transactions and added repository unit coverage for:
    - sysDescr de-duplication
    - device_details de-duplication
    - deterministic listing and ordering (timestamp + transaction_id tie-break)

- **M4 is now in progress (repositories exist; cutover tasks remain):**
  - DB repositories for capture groups and operation→capture group linkage exist.
  - A compatibility layer exists for legacy column naming differences (operation_id vs operation_capture_id).
  - Remaining work is primarily cutover enforcement: stop runtime reads/writes of the capture/operation JSON ledgers and shift remaining endpoints/services fully to DB.

- `install.sh`
  - DB backend selection runs before `pytest` so tests execute against the selected backend contract.
  - Added `--db-install-sqlite` and `--db-install-postgres`, plus an interactive prompt when no flag is provided (defaults to SQLite in non-interactive/CI).
  - Added Postgres DSN prompt with password redaction (passwords are not persisted into `system.json`).
  - Fixed DSN redaction backreference and aligned DSN env-var warning logic to `POSTGRES_DSN_ENV_VAR` via indirect expansion.

- `docs/system/system-config.md`
  - Updated `PnmFileRetrieval` heading/anchor for GitHub compatibility.
  - Documented runtime DB location policy and recommended env var usage for Postgres DSNs.

Out-of-scope but in-flight (separate hygiene workstream): Ruff baseline cleanup (125 remaining issues after `ruff check . --fix`, including `PnmParsers` undefined name).

## Phase 7.7 Burndown Tracker (Updated 2026-01-11)

This tracker is a near-term hygiene lane that should remain compatible with the DB migration. It is not a replacement for the DB cutover milestones.

### Recent Completions

- Unified operation workflow payload shape:
  - Dual-status support (legacy `status` string + canonical `service_status`)
  - Centralized workflow schemas via re-exports
  - Registry status responses aligned to shared `time_remaining` contract
- Multi-capture registry status endpoints aligned to `time_remaining` contract:
  - Multi-RxMER `/advance/multiRxMer/status` (POST)
  - Multi-ChannelEstimation `/advance/multiChannelEstimation/status` (POST)
  - Safe coercion and default fallback when missing/invalid
- Docs updated:
  - `docs/api/fast-api/multi/capture-operation.md` updated to reflect unified payload shape
- Tests added/updated:
  - Operation workflow dual-status tests
  - Multi-RxMER + Multi-ChannelEstimation registry `time_remaining` behavior tests
  - Transaction repository unit tests and multi-capture result tests seeded via DB
- Verification complete:
  - `python3 -m compileall src` pass
  - `ruff check .` pass
  - `ruff format --check .` pass
  - `pytest -q` pass (583 passed, 4 skipped)

### Remaining Phase 7.7 TODOs (Open Items)

1) Address `PytestConfigWarning` related to `asyncio_mode` configuration
   - Goal: eliminate warning via explicit pytest config (no runtime impact, but hygiene blocker)

2) Final “legacy-key hygiene” scan
   - Goal: confirm no remaining deprecated/legacy keys or payload fields are being written or relied upon unintentionally
   - Scope: operation/capture records, workflow responses, and multi-capture start/status/result payloads

### Validation Gate (Must Stay Green)

- `python3 -m compileall src`
- `ruff check .`
- `ruff format --check .`
- `pytest -q`
- Optional (when enabled): SNMP integration tests via `PNM_CM_IT`
- Optional (when enabled): Postgres schema init via `PYPNM_DB_POSTGRES_DSN`

## Open Issues From Review Bundles (Updated 2026-01-11)

These are implementation follow-ups that are not blocked by the milestone plan but should be addressed during M4/M5 hardening.

1) Potential bug in `PnmFileTransaction.insert()`
   - Risk: passing `cable_modem.get_mac_address` (callable) instead of invoking it.
   - Requirement: ensure an actual MAC value is used consistently (normalized to lowercase).

2) Transaction ID generation hardening (keep the 16-char prefix contract)
   - Current: sha256(filename + timestamp) with truncation.
   - Improve: add higher-resolution time (e.g., `time.time_ns()`), plus MAC and/or test type.

3) Magic-number cleanup
   - Example: DEFAULT_HEXDUMP_BYTES_PER_LINE = 16 defined inside a function.
   - Requirement: promote to a named constant.

4) Refactor long if/elif chains to `match/case`
   - Target: `PnmFileService.__get_analysis()` (behavior unchanged).

5) Strict typing improvement
   - Target: `_RepositoryBase._from_system_config` should return `Self` (or an equivalent strict typing approach).

## Locked Decisions (Selection Summary)

This burndown must implement (and keep consistent with the design doc) the locked decision set:

`1A, 2B+2.1B, 3B, 4A(SQLite)+4C(Postgres when PyPNM-CMTS/multi-worker), 5C+5.1A, 6B+6.1A, 7B, 8A`

Implications that must remain explicit in tasks and acceptance criteria:

- PyPNM owns backend selection and schema init; PyPNM-CMTS is a consumer only.
- `install.sh` defaults to SQLite and prompts when no flag is provided.
- Postgres secrets must be supported via env var overrides; `pypnm/pypnm` is dev/CI only.
- Schema apply is idempotent from shipped DDL assets; seeds UNKNOWN sysDescr and artifact store rows.
- SQLite is for single-writer; Postgres is recommended for multi-worker and PyPNM-CMTS.
- DB stores portable app-root relative paths; runtime resolution builds absolute paths.
- CI must validate SQLite and Postgres (Postgres via service container; not “allowed failure”).
- JSON ledgers are deprecated; removal is tracked explicitly in M6 (do not introduce new ledger features).

## Milestones

Status guidance:

- Complete: done and validated.
- In progress: started, partials landed.
- Not started: planned.

Milestone status (as of 2026-01-11):

- M0: In progress (docs updated; packaging/docker hygiene still open)
- M1: In progress (installer selection landed; config template + settings accessors still open)
- M2: Complete (DB schema init + backend-aware connection path landed; schema manager in use)
- M3: Complete (transactions and JSON export artifacts are DB-backed; legacy ledger paths are not used at runtime)
- M4: In progress (capture groups + operation linkage repositories exist; JSON ledger cutover and endpoint wiring still open)
- M5: Not started (artifact linkage; DB becomes authoritative for path resolution)
- M6: Not started (delete ledger code paths and ledger docs)
- M7: Partially done (Postgres CI job plumbing landed; full DB-backed test suite + ledger removal assertions pending)

## Phase 0 · Guardrails And Release Hygiene (M0)

### Goal

Prevent DB/data leakage into releases and formalize runtime data placement.

### Tasks

- [ ] Add `.data/` and `demo/.data/` to `.gitignore` and confirm no tracked data remains.
- [ ] Ensure Python packaging excludes runtime data:
  - [ ] Exclude `.data/**` and `demo/.data/**` from sdist/wheel.
  - [ ] Confirm build config does not include runtime paths.
- [ ] Ensure Docker build excludes runtime data:
  - [ ] `.dockerignore` includes `.data/`, `demo/.data/`, `*.sqlite3`, `*.db`.
  - [ ] Dockerfiles do not `COPY` `.data/` or demo datasets into images.
- [x] Document runtime DB location rules:
  - [x] SQLite path under `.data/db/`
  - [x] Postgres external (no local DB file)
- [x] Add doc note: demo uses isolated root (`demo/`) and isolated DB.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Building sdist/wheel does not contain `.data/` or any DB files.
- [ ] Docker images do not contain `.data/` contents.
- [x] Docs state the runtime DB location policy clearly.

## Phase 1 · Install-Time Backend Selection And Config Contract (M1)

### Goal

Make DB backend selection a first-class install-time choice owned by PyPNM and visible in docs.

### Tasks

- [x] Extend `install.sh`:
  - [x] Support `--db-install-postgres`
  - [x] Support `--db-install-sqlite`
  - [x] Add interactive prompt if no flag provided (default: SQLite)
  - [x] Add install-time warning text:
    - [x] SQLite is recommended for standalone PyPNM / single-writer
    - [x] Postgres is recommended for PyPNM-CMTS and/or multi-worker/multi-process
  - [x] Add a Postgres config prompt path when Postgres is selected:
    - [x] Allow DSN entry OR discrete fields that render into a DSN
    - [x] Host / port / database / user / password / ssl mode
    - [x] Ensure password can be provided via env var override (no plaintext requirement in JSON)
    - [x] Ensure passwords are not persisted into `system.json` (DSN redaction + field-based DSN omits password)

- [ ] Add config keys to `settings/system.json.template` (and demo template if used):
  - [ ] `Database.backend` = `sqlite` | `postgres`
  - [ ] `Database.sqlite.path` default `.data/db/pypnm.sqlite3`
  - [ ] Postgres connection settings:
    - [ ] Support `Database.postgres.dsn`
    - [ ] Optional discrete settings for UX (installer can populate DSN)
  - [ ] Support environment variable overrides for secrets (do not require plaintext passwords in tracked JSON)

- [ ] Add `SystemConfigSettings` accessors for DB settings.

- [x] Ensure docs explicitly describe:
  - [x] Install-time backend selection mechanism
  - [x] SQLite vs Postgres recommendation (single-writer vs multi-worker)
  - [ ] PyPNM-CMTS inherits backend (no separate selection)

- [ ] Add pytest coverage for config defaults and validation (missing/blank handling).

### Notes: Postgres Credentials Policy

- Development defaults like `pypnm/pypnm` are acceptable for local dev and CI only.
- Do not recommend these credentials for production.
- Prefer environment variables or a local `.env` file for passwords and DSNs.
- Do not commit `.env` or populated DB settings containing real credentials.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Fresh install can select backend via flag or prompt.
- [ ] Config settings are available via `SystemConfigSettings`.
- [ ] Tests cover selection and default behavior.

## Phase 2 · Schema Introduction And DB Abstraction Layer (M2)

### Goal

Introduce both schemas and a stable DB API that hides backend differences.

### Tasks

- [x] Ensure schema assets exist and are treated as authoritative:
  - [x] `docs/design/db/schema_postgres.sql`
  - [x] `docs/design/db/schema_sqlite.sql`

- [x] Implement DB connection layer in PyPNM:
  - [x] SQLite connection opens with `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`
  - [x] SQLite enables WAL + sets a busy timeout (to reduce transient contention)
  - [x] Postgres connection opens via DSN (minimum) or discrete settings
  - [x] Minimal connection factory based on `Database.backend`

- [x] Implement schema apply/init (idempotent, using shipped DDL assets):
  - [x] Apply DDL idempotently on startup/install
  - [x] Seed canonical `UNKNOWN` sysDescr row idempotently
  - [x] Seed default `artifact_stores` row idempotently:
    - [x] prod store: `.data/pnm`
    - [ ] demo store: `demo/.data/pnm` (only if demo enabled/used)

- [x] Add “DB health” check function for diagnostics:
  - [x] Connect, verify required tables exist, verify `UNKNOWN` row exists
  - [x] Verify schema version compatibility (`schema_meta.schema_version`)

- [x] Add pytest coverage:
  - [x] SQLite: init creates tables and seed rows (pure unit test)
  - [x] Postgres: init path is wired; CI runs minimal integration

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] PyPNM can initialize DB schema for SQLite reliably.
- [x] Postgres path is implemented and can be exercised with integration tests.
- [x] `UNKNOWN` sysDescr exists after init.
- [x] Schema version mismatch fails fast with an actionable error.

## Phase 3 · Transactions Migration (DB-Backed Transactions) (M3)

### Goal

Replace the legacy JSON transaction ledger with DB-backed `transaction_records` plus de-dup dimensions, and update endpoint read paths.

Cutover note:

- Runtime must stop writing and reading legacy JSON transaction ledgers once DB-backed transactions are enabled.
- Other ledgers (`capture_group.json`, `operation_capture.json`) remain until M4.

### Tasks

- [x] Implement repository/service layer:
  - [x] `SystemDescriptionRepository` (upsert by hash)
  - [x] `DeviceDetailsRepository` (upsert by hash, FK sysDescr)
  - [x] `TransactionRepository` (insert/get/list/search)

- [x] Enforce safeguards:
  - [x] MAC normalization in app (lowercase)
  - [x] Rely on DB CHECK constraints for MAC format enforcement

- [x] Update transaction creation/read code to use DB:
  - [x] Stop writing legacy JSON transaction ledgers
  - [x] Preserve external API shapes as needed by current services/endpoints

- [x] Track JSON export artifacts in DB (file_artifacts + transaction_artifacts; no JSON ledger)

- [x] Update file-manager endpoints to query DB (no JSON ledger traversal):
  - [x] `getMacAddresses`
  - [x] `searchFiles/{mac_address}`
  - [x] `download/transactionID/{transaction_id}` resolves filename via DB record (artifact linkage becomes authoritative in M5)

- [x] Add pytest coverage:
  - [x] Insert transaction creates dims (sysDescr/device details)
  - [x] De-dup sysDescr across multiple transactions
  - [x] De-dup device details across multiple transactions
  - [x] Endpoint-compatible query behavior (service-level tests)

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Captures produce DB rows instead of writing legacy JSON ledgers.
- [x] File manager flows can fetch transactions from DB (no JSON ledger traversal for transactions).
- [x] There is no runtime write/read path that touches legacy JSON ledgers.
- [x] JSON export artifacts are tracked in DB without JSON ledger files.

## Phase 4 · Capture Group And Operation Migration (Replace `capture_group.json`, `operation_capture.json`) (M4)

### Goal

Move multi-capture and operation tracking to DB, updating operation-based endpoints.

Cutover note:

- This phase stops runtime writes to capture-group and operation ledgers.
- Once complete, operation status/result endpoints must resolve via DB-backed repositories.

### Tasks

- [x] Implement `CaptureGroupRepository`:
  - [x] Create capture group
  - [x] Add ordered transaction membership (`position`)
  - [x] Load capture group with ordered transactions

- [x] Implement `OperationCaptureRepository`:
  - [x] Create operation capture linking to capture group
  - [x] Resolve operation capture -> capture group -> ordered transaction list
  - [x] Support legacy schema compatibility (`operation_id` vs `operation_capture_id`) without branching call sites

- [ ] Update existing grouping/operation services to use DB end-to-end:
  - [ ] Stop writing `.data/db/capture_group.json`
  - [ ] Stop writing `.data/db/operation_capture.json`
  - [ ] Stop reading capture/operation ledgers from runtime paths
  - [ ] Ensure multi-capture start/status/result endpoints resolve operation/group via DB only

- [ ] Update file-manager endpoint behavior:
  - [ ] `download/operationID/{operation_id}` resolves op -> group -> ordered tx list via DB

- [ ] Add pytest coverage:
  - [ ] Position uniqueness within group
  - [ ] Operation capture references group correctly
  - [ ] Endpoint path resolution uses DB (service-level tests)
  - [ ] Explicit assertion: no runtime read/write of capture/operation JSON ledgers

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Multi-capture workflows no longer use JSON ledger files.
- [ ] Operation workflows resolve through DB (no JSON traversal).
- [ ] There is no runtime write path that touches capture/operation ledger JSON.

## Phase 5 · Artifact Linkage (Filesystem References) (M5)

### Goal

Make file linkage explicit via `artifact_stores`, `file_artifacts`, and `transaction_artifacts` so file resolution is DB-driven.

### Tasks

- [ ] Implement repositories:
  - [ ] `ArtifactStoreRepository`:
    - [ ] Ensure a default store exists (prod)
    - [ ] Ensure demo store exists when demo mode is used

  - [ ] `FileArtifactRepository`:
    - [ ] Insert/upsert file artifacts (sha256 + relative path)
    - [ ] Store `relative_path` relative to artifact store root
    - [ ] Capture `size_bytes` and optional `mime_type`

  - [ ] `TransactionArtifactRepository`:
    - [ ] Link transaction to artifact via `role`

- [ ] Update capture flow:
  - [ ] On capture success, write artifact row and link to transaction (`role=pnm_raw`)

- [ ] Update upload flow:
  - [ ] Create transaction using `UNKNOWN` sysDescr when sysDescr is missing
  - [ ] Store artifact linkage to uploaded file (`role=pnm_uploaded_raw`)

- [ ] Update file-manager service methods to resolve through artifact linkage:
  - [ ] `get_pnm_path_for_transaction()` resolves by role preference:
    - [ ] Prefer `pnm_raw`
    - [ ] Fallback `pnm_uploaded_raw`
  - [ ] Keep `transaction_records.filename` for readability/back-compat, but do not treat it as authoritative

- [ ] Add pytest coverage:
  - [ ] Resolve absolute paths from `app_root + store.root_path + artifact.relative_path`
  - [ ] Demo root isolation (`demo/.data/...` paths)
  - [ ] ZIP archive generation for MAC and operation uses DB-linked artifacts

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Transactions resolve to binaries without any legacy settings JSON linkage.
- [ ] Demo and prod are isolated by data root and DB.
- [ ] Endpoints resolve files via DB artifact linkage exclusively.

## Phase 6 · Remove Ledger JSON Design And Code (M6)

### Goal

Delete ledger JSON code paths and remove ledger JSON design from documentation, replacing it with DB backend documentation.

### Tasks

- [ ] Remove JSON ledger creation paths:
  - [ ] Stop creating `.data/db/*.json` ledgers in capture flows
  - [ ] Remove any remaining ledger read code paths

- [ ] Remove or deprecate config keys related to ledgers:
  - [ ] `transaction_db`, `capture_group_db`, `operation_db`, `json_transaction_db`

- [ ] Remove or repurpose ledger modules:
  - [ ] Remove `pypnm/lib/db/json_transaction.py` if no longer needed
  - [ ] Remove/retire any code paths that still materialize ledger JSON in memory

- [ ] Documentation cleanup (explicit requirement):
  - [ ] Remove/replace all doc references to:
    - [ ] legacy JSON ledger paths for transactions, capture groups, and operations
  - [ ] Update file-manager docs to state DB-backed persistence for transactions/groups/operations
  - [ ] Ensure diagrams and examples reflect DB-backed persistence and artifact linkage

- [ ] MkDocs + tooling support for Mermaid (if not already satisfied in the repo):
  - [ ] Update `mkdocs.yml` to render Mermaid fences (Material: `pymdownx.superfences`)
  - [ ] Add the Mermaid plugin dependency to the docs extras in `pyproject.toml` (avoid redundant deps)

- [ ] Final hygiene scan:
  - [ ] Ensure no `.data/` artifacts are tracked or packaged

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] No code path depends on JSON ledgers at runtime.
- [ ] Docs and examples reflect DB backend design (no ledger design remains as “current”).
- [ ] Release artifacts contain no DB data.

## Phase 7 · Pytest And GitHub Actions Migration (M7)

### Goal

Ensure all tests and GitHub workflows pass with the new DB layer, removing ledger assumptions and validating Postgres support.

### Tasks

- [ ] Pytest refactor:
  - [ ] Locate and update/remove any tests that read/write `.data/db/*.json`
  - [ ] Replace ledger fixtures with DB fixtures (SQLite by default)
  - [ ] Add DB test utilities:
    - [ ] Temporary SQLite DB per test (or per module) under `tmp_path`
    - [ ] Schema init helper (idempotent DDL apply)
    - [ ] Seed helper for artifact stores and `UNKNOWN` sysDescr
  - [ ] Convert endpoint-level tests (if present) to use DB-backed services (no JSON)

- [ ] GitHub Actions refactor (required for DB backend release confidence):
  - [ ] Add a DB backend test matrix:
    - [ ] SQLite job (required)
    - [x] Postgres job (required; not “allowed failure”)
  - [x] Postgres service container job:
    - [x] Use `postgres` service with `POSTGRES_USER=pypnm`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pypnm`, `POSTGRES_DB=pypnm`
    - [x] Provide DSN via env var to tests (no committed secrets)
    - [x] Apply schema during test setup (idempotent)
  - [ ] Ensure tests remain hermetic:
    - [ ] No external CMTS/SNMP dependencies in CI

- [ ] Developer documentation:
  - [x] Document what backends CI validates
  - [x] Document how to run Postgres tests locally (docker compose recommended)
  - [x] Document DSN override via environment variables

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `pytest` passes locally for SQLite with DB-backed services.
- [ ] GitHub Actions passes with SQLite in the DB-backed test path.
- [x] Postgres path is validated in CI with a service container.

## Cross-Cutting Requirements

### PyPNM-CMTS Contract

- [ ] PyPNM-CMTS must not select a different backend than PyPNM.
- [ ] All DB interactions in PyPNM-CMTS must occur through PyPNM APIs only.

### Runtime Cutover Rule

- [ ] Runtime must not fall back to JSON ledger reads once DB read paths exist for that domain.
- [ ] Any legacy ledger handling must be isolated to an offline migrator tool (optional) and must not be required for normal runtime.

### Docker And K8 Notes

- [ ] SQLite: require a persistent volume mount for `.data/` and single-writer deployment.
- [ ] Postgres: require DSN secrets/config; stateless PyPNM containers.

### Testing

- [ ] Every phase adds pytest coverage for new/changed behavior.
- [ ] Tests must not require external CMTS or live SNMP.
- [ ] Treat deprecation warnings as failures.

## Suggested Codex Tracking Rules

Codex should maintain a running checklist aligned to these phases:

- Current phase and status
- Files changed in the phase
- Tests added and executed
- CI workflow impacts validated
- Deferred items (with rationale)

## Phase 2 · Schema Introduction And DB Abstraction Layer (M2) Status Block

- Status: Complete (schema assets authoritative, startup idempotent schema init, connection factory, health check, seeds for UNKNOWN sysDescr and default artifact store)
- Verified gates: compileall, ruff check, ruff format --check, pytest all green in the latest bundle
- Known deltas: demo artifact store seeding only required if demo mode is actively supported; otherwise defer to M5/demo hardening
- Next dependencies: M4 cutover enforcement (eliminate capture/operation JSON ledger runtime usage), then M5 artifact linkage as the authoritative file resolver
